                    "In this short game, you will experience the growth of a small 
                    robot after it finds something precious it needs to protect."<br><br>
                    
                    This was my entry into the GMTK Game Jam 2024. Having only four 
                    days to work on this game, I had to keep the visuals and mechanics 
                    limited. The game itself is a narrative-driven experience where you 
                    play as a little robot collecting materials. By deconstructing and 
                    destroying the environment you're playing in, you grow incrementally 
                    larger and destroy more levels as you go.<br><br>

                    This was my first attempt at weaving a narrative into a video game. 
                    I paid special attention to the music and visuals, and how that affects 
                    the mood as the player experiences the story.<br><br>


                    I learned a lot about keeping a project's scope in check while working 
                    on this game, as well as managing my time. Every second counts while 
                    working on a game jam, and where you direct your effort can radically 
                    change the final product. I also worked on figuring out how to manage cut 
                    scenes and how they can ease in and out of gameplay for advanced storytelling.
