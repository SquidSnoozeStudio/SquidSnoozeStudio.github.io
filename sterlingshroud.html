                    "Sterling Shroud is a point-and-click atmospheric horror game 
                    with a focus on navigation and puzzle solving. Can you escape the 
                    forest alive?"<br><br>

                    This game is a 2D point-and-click horror game that sees you navigating 
                    a dark forest in an attempt to escape, or at least uncover the truth 
                    about what is holding you there. While solving classic point-and-click 
                    puzzles and reading notes left behind by others, you navigate the forest 
                    using a map that you manage!<br><br>

                    This was the first game I published on Steam! I really buckled down with 
                    this project and focused on polish and professionalism. What I'm most 
                    proud of with this game is the map the player fills in themselves and 
                    the puzzles that go hand-in-hand with that feature.<br><br>

                    I became very familiar with the process of playtesting while working on this 
                    project. Collecting feedback from testers helped me fashion a more intuitive, 
                    fun, and interesting game. Managing an expansive dialogue system was also a new 
                    challenge for me, but one that I overcame with time and experience.
