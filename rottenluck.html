                    "Try and escape the zombie-infested city! In this action-packed 
                    twin-stick shooter, face the hoards of undead as you navigate through 
                    the ruins of the city, using weapon upgrades and item power-ups to survive. 
                    But with your rotten luck, you won't make it out alive!"<br><br>

                    While not a part of any game jam, I treated this personal project as 
                    though it was and limited my development time to seven days. It plays 
                    like a 2D twin-stick shooter mixed with a dungeon crawler. You roam the 
                    city and fight off zombies, using items and weapons you find to aid you 
                    in combat. After clearing the room you move on to the next. Rinse and repeat 
                    until you find the subway and escape from the city.<br><br>

                    While working on this game, I became more experienced with level design. Having 
                    varied enemies, weapons, and environmental elements opened up opportunities to make 
                    some very interesting and fun levels.<br><br>

                    Above all, this project taught me how to actually publish a complete game. There's 
                    a lot of hard work involved, including sound design, menus, closing gameplay loops, 
                    general polish, bug fixes, and more. Despite the challenges presented, I was able to 
                    complete the game within the self-imposed time limit.
